# Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning ðŸ“ˆðŸ¤–ðŸ“‰

Gold Price Prediction using Machine Learning is a project focused on employing machine learning techniques to forecast the price of gold. 

## Importing Libraries

ðŸ“š We will import all the libraries that we will be using throughout this article in one place so that we do not have to import every time we use it, saving both our time and effort.

- **Pandas**: A Python library built on top of NumPy for effective matrix multiplication and dataframe manipulation. It is also used for data cleaning, data merging, data reshaping, and data aggregation.

- **Numpy**: A Python library used for numerical mathematical computation and handling multidimensional ndarray. It also has a very large collection of mathematical functions to operate on this array.

- **Matplotlib**: It is used for plotting 2D and 3D visualization plots. It also supports a variety of output formats including graphs.

- **Seaborn**: Seaborn library is built on top of Matplotlib and is used for plotting beautiful plots.
